### Demonstration: How to Add a Chat Room to a Web Application by using SignalR

#### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20486C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20486-DevelopingASPNETMVCWebApplications/tree/master/Allfiles
2. Start **File Explorer**.
3. Navigate to **Allfiles/20486C/Mod14/Democode/OperasWebsites_14_begin**.
4. Double-click **OperasWebsites.sln**.

#### Demonstration Steps

1. On the **Tools** menu of the **OperasWebsites - Microsoft Visual Studio** window, point to **NuGet Package Manager**, and then click **Package Manager Console**.
2. In **Package Manager Console** window, type the following command, and then press Enter

  ```cs
       Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR -Version 2.2.2
```
3. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand **Scripts**.

    >**Note:** NuGet Package Manager has added files for SignalR to the application. Note the version number for SignalR.


4. In the **Solution Explorer** pane of the **OperasWebsites – Microsoft Visual Studio** window, right-click **OperasWebsites**, point to **Add**, and then click **Class**.
5. In the **Name** box of the **Add New Item – OperasWebsites** dialog box, type **ChatHub**, and then click **Add**.
6. In the ChatHub.cs code window, locate the following code.

  ```cs
		using System.Web;
```
7. Place the cursor at the end of the located code, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		using Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR;
```
8. In the ChatHub.cs code window, locate the following code.

  ```cs
		public class ChatHub
```
9. Replace the located code with the following code.

  ```cs
		public class ChatHub : Hub
```
10. In the **ChatHub** class code block, type the following code.

  ```cs
        public void Send(string name, string message)
        {
        }
```
11. In the **Send** method code block, type the following code.

  ```cs
		Clients.All.broadcastMessage(name, message);
```
  >**Note:** The **Send()** method sends any received message back to all the clients that are connected to the hub. You need to define the **broadcastMessage()** method in the client-side code to receive messages. The client-side code must also call the **Send()** method to broadcast messages.

12. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, right click **OperasWebsites** project, click **Add**, and then click **Class**.
13. Name the class **Startup.cs** and click **Add**.
14. Locate ```using System.Web;``` and add the following using statements just after it.
  ```cs
    using Owin;
    using Microsoft.Owin;
    [assembly: OwinStartup(typeof(OperasWebsites.Startup))]
```
15. Within the **Startup** class, type the following code.
  ```cs
        public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
        {
            // Any connection or hub wire up and configuration should go here
            app.MapSignalR();
        }
```

16. In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand **Views**, expand **Home**, and then click **Chat.cshtml**.
17. In the Chat.cshtml code window, within the final **&lt;script&gt;** element, type the following code.

  ```cs
        $(function() {
        });
```
18. Within the anonymous function you just created, type the following code.

  ```cs
		var chat = $.connection.chatHub;
```
19. Place the cursor at the end of the variable you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        chat.client.broadcastMessage = function(name, message) {
        };
```
  >**Note:** This function is the implementation of the **broadcastMessage()** function that you called in the Hub code.

20. Within the anonymous function you just created, type the following code.

  ```cs
		var listItem = '<li>' + name + ': ' + message + '</li>';
```
21. Place the cursor at the end of the variable you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		$('#discussion').append(listItem);
```
22. Place the cursor at the end of the **broadcastMessage** function code block, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		var displayname = prompt('Enter your name:', '');
```
23. Place the cursor at the end of the **displayname** variable code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		$('#chat-message').focus();
```
24. Place the cursor at the end of the code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        $.connection.hub.start().done(function() {
        });
```
25. Within the anonymous function code block you just created, type the following code.

  ```cs
        $('#sendmessage').click(function() {
        });
```
26. Within the new anonymous function code block you just created, type the following code.

  ```cs
		chat.server.send(displayname, $('#chat-message').val());
```
27. Place the cursor at the end of the code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
		$('#chat-message').val('').focus();
```
28. On the **DEBUG** menu of the **OperasWebsites – Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click **Start Debugging**.
